# nodejs_forge_view_model with subpath and haproxy support


## Prerequiriments

* **NodeJS** installed. Instructions [HERE](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* **HAPROXY** installed. Instructions [HERE](http://www.haproxy.org/)
* **Autodesk Forge App** Created. Instructions [HERE](https://forge.autodesk.com/)
* **VS Code** Installed. Instructions [HERE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (optional for IDE programming)



## 1. Clone the Project from the Terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roger10cassares/nodejs_forge_view_model.git
```

OR

Download the project `nodejs_forge_view_model-main.zip` and rename the folder to match nodejs_forge_sample name. Here bellow is the example from terminal:

```bash
unzip nodejs_forge_view_model-main.zip
mv nodejs_forge_view_model-mian.zip nodejs_forge_view_model
```



## 2. Open the Top Level Directory in VS Code

Go to the top leval directory of this project and run the command to open Visual Studio Code from the terminal:

```bash
cd nodejs_forge_view_model
code .
```



## 3. Create .env file

Create an `.env` file at the top leval project directory: Right Click in blank area above the paths then, clik in New file option and name this with `.env` name.

The Autodesk Forge App credentials shall be preview created and located at https://forge.autodesk.com/myapps/ web address:

* App information (Created on 11 Apr 2021)
* Basic information about your app.
* Client ID:YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE
* Client Secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE
* App Name: YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE
* Description: YOUR_DESCRIPTION_HERE
* CallBack URL:http://localhost/bim/api/forge/callback/oauthThe .env file must match the information described above from [Autodesk Forge App](https://forge.autodesk.com/) at https://forge.autodesk.com/myapps/.

Add the following line according your App account inside the `.env` file.

```env
  FORGE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE
  FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE

  # FORGE_CALLBACK_URL is only for 3-legged OAuth
  FORGE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost/forge/api/forge/callback/oauth 
```

At this point you are able to run the `nodejs` service without `haproxy` support. Follow steps `5` and `6`, then access your server at http://localhost:3000/forge. 

> *Note: For 3-legged OAuth work properly, set the Callback URL for http://localhost:3000/forge/api/forge/callback/oauth both in `.env` file and Autodesk Forge App at https://forge.autodesk.com/myapps/*

```bash
use_backend localhost_forge if { hdr(host) -i localhost } { path -i -m beg /forge }

backend localhost_bim
    server server_localhost_forge localhost:3000/forge
```

Save and close the file with Ctrl^O, ENTER, Ctrl^X, then restart the HAPROXY Service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart haproxy.service
```

The correspondig haproxy.cfg was provided at examples/haproxy/haproxy.cfg file.
